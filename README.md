# Fault-detection-in-pv-systems-using-ML
Solar industry has rapidly grown over the past several years and photovoltaic (PV) systems in particular have significantly expanded. 
Detection and prediction of various faults in the PV system is a key factor to increase the efficiency, reliability, and lifetime of the PV system.
Different methods are required for different types of faults.
# OBJECTIVES
To study various possible faults that occur in PV panels.
Analyzing the suitable ML algorithm in the fault diagnosis of PV panels
